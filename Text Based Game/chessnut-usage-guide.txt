# Using Your Chessnut Pro with Grand Chess Realms

## During Gameplay

### Starting a Chess Match

When you enter a chess match in the game, the following will happen:

1. The game will automatically check if your Chessnut Pro is connected
2. If connected, you'll see a message: "âœ“ Chessnut Pro board detected - you can make moves physically on your board"
3. Set up your physical board in the starting position (if it isn't already)
4. The match will begin as normal

### Making Moves

You have two ways to make moves:

#### Physical Moves on the Chessnut Pro

1. Simply move the piece on your physical board
2. The move will be automatically detected and sent to the game
3. You'll see confirmation in the terminal: "Move detected on physical board: [move]"
4. If legal, the move will be executed in the game

#### Manual Input (Backup)

If the board doesn't detect your move or you prefer keyboard input:
1. Type your move in UCI format (e.g., `e2e4`) at the prompt
2. Press Enter to execute the move

### Opponent's Moves

When your opponent makes a move:
1. The move will be displayed in the terminal
2. You need to manually make this move on your physical Chessnut board
3. This keeps your physical board synchronized with the game state

## Command Reference

### New Command: `chessnut`

Type `chessnut` at any time to:
- Check the connection status of your Chessnut Pro
- Attempt to reconnect if the connection was lost
- View basic usage information

### Troubleshooting During Play

If your board isn't detecting moves properly:

1. Check the Chessnut Pro status with the `chessnut` command
2. Make sure pieces are properly placed on the squares
3. Try making the move again, ensuring pieces are firmly placed
4. If still having issues, you can always fall back to manual move input

### Making Special Moves

For special chess moves:

- **Castling**: Make the king's full move on the board (e.g., e1g1 for white kingside castling)
- **En Passant**: Simply capture the pawn as you normally would
- **Promotion**: Move your pawn to the 8th rank, and the game will prompt you for the promotion piece

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a clean setup**: Always begin matches with all pieces in the correct starting positions
2. **Mirror opponent moves carefully**: Make the exact moves your opponent makes in the game
3. **Be deliberate with your moves**: Place pieces firmly in the center of squares
4. **Check for successful detection**: Watch for the move confirmation message in the terminal
5. **Keep the board charged**: Ensure your Chessnut Pro has sufficient battery charge for your gaming session

Enjoy the enhanced immersion of playing Grand Chess Realms with your physical Chessnut Pro chess board!
