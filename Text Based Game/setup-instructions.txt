## Overview

Grand Chess Realms is a text-based RPG where every significant conflict is resolved through classical chess matches. This game features:

- Rich, lore-heavy narrative set in a world divided between White and Black Kingdoms
- Full chess integration using the Stockfish chess engine
- Character creation and development
- NPC interactions with dialogue trees
- Dice-based mechanics for exploration and social interactions
- Quest system with branching storylines

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `python-chess`
  - Other standard libraries: `os`, `sys`, `time`, `random`, `pickle`
- Stockfish chess engine (optional but recommended for best experience)

## Installation

1. First, make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install python-chess
   ```

3. Download Stockfish chess engine:
   - Windows: [Stockfish for Windows](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)
   - Mac: `brew install stockfish` or download from the website
   - Linux: Use your package manager (e.g., `apt install stockfish`) or download directly

4. Place the Stockfish executable in one of these locations (or update the path in the code):
   - In the same directory as the game files
   - In a subdirectory named `engines/`
   - In your system PATH

5. Organize your project files as follows:
   ```
   grand_chess_realms/
   ├── main_game.py           # Main script to run the game
   ├── game_structure.py      # Core game structure
   ├── chess_engine_integration.py  # Chess integration
   ├── dice_mechanics.py      # Dice mechanics for non-chess events
   ├── lore_and_story.py      # Lore and story management
   ├── stockfish              # Stockfish executable (optional location)
   └── engines/               # Another optional location for Stockfish
       └── stockfish
   ```

## Running the Game

1. Navigate to the game directory in your terminal/command prompt.

2. Run the main game script:
   ```
   python main_game.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create your character and begin your journey.

## Game Controls

- Other: `tip` to get a chess tip, `quit` to exit the game

## Chess Controls

During chess matches:
- Enter moves in UCI format (e.g., `e2e4`, `g1f3`) or algebraic notation (e.g., `e4`, `Nf3`)

## Tips for New Players

1. Talk to everyone - NPCs provide valuable information, quests, and chess opportunities.
2. Explore thoroughly - hidden locations may contain useful items or lore.
3. Improve your chess skills - better performance in chess matches leads to story progression.
4. Pay attention to the lore - understanding the world helps make meaningful choices.
5. Use the dice mechanics for non-chess situations when appropriate.
