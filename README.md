# Grand Chess Realms

Welcome to **Grand Chess Realms** – an open-source tabletop RPG where classical chess is at the heart of every epic conflict. This project is designed to keep the pure, unaltered mechanics of over-the-board chess while surrounding it with a rich, immersive lore and narrative that transforms every chess match into a legendary duel.

---

## Overview

**Grand Chess Realms** was born out of a lifelong passion for chess and a desire to see the game transcend its traditional boundaries. Inspired by the immersive universes of Dungeons & Dragons and World of Warcraft, this RPG:
- **Preserves Classical Chess:** Every major confrontation is resolved by a full 8×8 chess match using standard rules.
- **Delivers Deep Lore:** Explore a universe divided into two mythical kingdoms, each with its own backstory, characters, and epic conflicts.
- **Fosters Community Collaboration:** As an open-source project, we invite you to fork, contribute, and help evolve the universe. (Note: Some initial content was generated with AI assistance to serve as “skeleton” lore and placeholders—your creative input will bring it to life!)
